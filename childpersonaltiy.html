After gathering all data, they must be classified according to the frequently used color on that specific drawing, which shows that it is effortless to collect different drawings from the nurseries in a major way. Using image processing techniques really are used to particularly accomplish that task, showing how after discussing with basically several pre-schools, a bunch of Childs` drawings can really be used as data for the system, further showing how so it generally is effortless to for all intents and purposes collect different-different of drawings from the nurseries in a subtle way.

                    This component generally is one of the basically main components of our system in a subtle way. This process mainly deals with Children drawings, contrary to popular belief. First, system will provide a reference drawing to the child, or so they really thought. After done that task system will consider the color filling and white spaces that specific kid left on the canvas. According to those system start to make the predict. <br><br>
                    Considering the white space there are 5 categories divided in the system. Such as Peace, Calm, Natural, Impatient and Panic. If the specific kid left more white spaces that means the specific kid is Impatient or panic when they are drawing on canvas. But if the kid left medium white spaces that means that child is not impatient but he or she didn’t accomplish his/her task completely. If their white spaces are very Low that mean that specific child has very peaceful or calm mind when they draw drawings.  <br><br>
                    To analysis These things in this system use Deep learning techniques, algorithms, and image processing technology. This is the process is that happens automatically through this system. Mostly this system is used by small children. But this prediction is most usable for parents so there is a little detailed report predicted through the system to the parents. <br><br>
